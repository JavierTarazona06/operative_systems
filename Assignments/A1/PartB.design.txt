Part B Design

In this bash script will be handled partA1, partA2, partA3 and partA4 
(pending implementation) as args. Each selection will flow on a menu or 
batch reading that will receive 3 integers (number of threads, time in 
seconds as deadline and size) to run the assigned program of squares 
calculation.

So first, we will validate the input params to be positive integers and 
OS System will be checked to be Windows for PartA1. Also, it will 
support a manually method to insert args with a menu with an option to 
quit the program and also reading from a file in batch.

Functions that will be implemented:
- check_pos:
	- Check if the args passed is a positive integer.
	- It will checked with REGEX patterns.
	
- menu():
	- Available if args will be sent manually and executes program 
	according to versions partA1, partA2 and partA3 (partA4 pending).
	- CHecks that no more than 3 params are sent
	

The main program:
	- The first argument will be the version.
		- If version partA1, Windows compatibility will be checked.
		- If version is partA2 or partA3, Linux compatibility 
		will be checked
	- The second argument is the path of the input.txt file for batch 
	processing or nothing to proceed to the menu.
