   Assignment 1

PartC.testplan:
Functionality requirements:
	A c list library capable of making lists and adding nodes to those lists.
    Another c script will do automatic testing as follows:
Functions to be tested:
	ListCreate()
	ListFirst()
	ListLast()
	ListNext()
	ListPrev()
	ListCurrent()
	-ListAdd()
	-ListInsert()
	-ListAppend()
	-ListPrepend()
The above functions marked with a dash are of priority as they are the 
assignments major requirements for part c phase 2. The other functions
above will be used to test these important functions, and will themselves
be tested for this reason.

-Edge cases to consider:
	Using Create() to create more lists than the maximum number of lists.
	Using Create() to make exactly the maximum number of lists.
	Attempting to add more nodes than the maximum number of nodes.
	Making exactly the maximum number of nodes.
	Using listAdd() to add to the tail position.
	Using listAdd() to add to the head position.
	Using listInsert() to add to the tail position.
	Using listInsert() to add to the head position.

-Each test should complete in a reasonable time (essentially instantly), 
as everything so far is expected to be in O(1) time.
-The lists should be tested with multiple data types and should work 
the exact same regardless of held type.
-Passed tests should be silent, but a tally of passed tests should 
be kept and displayed.

-Our Makefile will also be tested. The library should compile for linux 
but not for windows. The compilation will be tested on the schools linux 
and windows machines to ensure the makefile is correctly enforcing 
the correct machinery.
