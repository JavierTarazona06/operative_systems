Part A Design

Design will be explained for each section.

# Part A.1

In essence the idea is to write a Windows program that creates 
multiple threads to compute squares of positive integers in 
parallel until a deadline without synchronization between threads.

So we have:
- Parent Thread:
	- Created child threads
	- Off until deadline
	- If deadline before threads getting completed, 
	global variable to exit.
- Child threads:
	- Compute square of positive integers
	- Remains checking global variable of parent 
	to know when to stop.
	
- Parameters:
	- threads: which are child threads
	- deadline: time in milliseconds to run threads
	- size: Max numerical limit that squares will reach
	
Landing the idea, we have:

1. Global variable:
	- Must be volatile as it will be changing all the time 
	and different parts of the code will be using it.
	volatile bool keepRunning = true;
	
2. Thread Functions:
	- Square of integers
	- Check keepRunning. If false -> stop
	
3. Parent Thread:
	- Created child threads
	- Id deadline is reached -> set keepRunning false
